# Gendiff
A simple tool that shows the difference between two **.json** or **.yaml** files.

There are 3 possible formats of display:
- stylish(default)
- plain
- json

The usage:

`gendiff [-h] [--format FORMAT] first_file second_file`

See below the [demonstration](#stylish) of the process.

### Installation:
Once you have the directory cloned and unpacked on your device, do the following steps:

Open the terminal window in your OS and open *../python-project-50/* directory in the terminal. Then type:

```sh
make install
```
```sh
make build
```
```sh
make package-install
``` 

In order to view help message, type:

`gendiff -h`

That's all!
